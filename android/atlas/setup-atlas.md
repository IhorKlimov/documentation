# Atlas overview
Atlas is a lightweight, flexible set of user interface components designed to enable developers to quickly and easily integrate native communications experiences into their applications. It was designed and built from the ground up to integrate with the Layer SDK. The Layer SDK provides developers with a simple, object oriented interface to the rich messaging capabilities provided by the Layer platform. Atlas, in turn, provides ready-made UI components that expose these capabilities directly to users.


```emphasis
Atlas for Android is currently in Preview Release (Beta). There are many planned changes to the codebase, and support will not be offered until it is deemed ready for General Availability. However, if you wish to use Atlas for Android in your project, it is available through GitHub as is, along with the following documentation.
```

## Setup

Atlas is built on top of the Layer SDK, and both are required to develop a fully featured messaging experience. The Atlas repository is open source, and you can find it [here on GitHub](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-Android). Check the GitHub repo for documentation and reference material
