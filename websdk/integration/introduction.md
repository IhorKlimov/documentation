# Web SDK

The Layer Web SDK is Layer's Javascript API for accessing Layer Services.  Its built on top of Layer's [Client APIs](/docs/client) which provides REST and Websocket APIs.  Typical javascript applications will be far easier to build using the Layer Web SDK which manages authentication, connections, websocket retries, etc.

The Web SDK is currently in **public beta**
