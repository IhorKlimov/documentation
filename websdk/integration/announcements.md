#Announcements
Announcements are a special `Message` type sent to a list of users or all users of the application that will arrive outside of the context of a conversation (the conversation property will be null). Announcements can only be sent through your web service using the [Platform API](https://developer.layer.com/docs/platform).

The Web SDK does not yet support recieving announcements.
