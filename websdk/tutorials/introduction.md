# Introduction

This tutorial helps build a simple chat application using Layer's Web SDK. It's using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) to provide a basic Event and View structure but keep in mind you don't need to know anything about how Backbone works to reason about the application we are building.

If your looking for a sample chat application rather than a tutorial, check our [Sample Apps](https://github.com/layerhq/samples-web-apis) where you will find examples built using different Javascript frameworks.

> This chat application requires you to use the [Layer Atlas](https://atlas.layer.com) Application ID and an Identity Service provided by Layer for building samples (NOT for production applications).
