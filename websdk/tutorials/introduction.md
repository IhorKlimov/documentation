# Introduction

This tutorial helps build a simple chat application using Layer's Web SDK. It uses [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) to provide a basic Event and View structure but keep in mind you don't need to know anything about how Backbone works to reason about the application we are building.

If you are looking for a sample chat application rather than a tutorial, check our [Sample Apps](https://github.com/layerhq/samples-web-apis) where you will find examples built using different Javascript frameworks.

```emphasis
This chat application should work with the App named `%%C-INLINE-APPNAME%%` (App ID: `%%C-INLINE-APPID%%`).  But you can also create a new Application from the Developer Dashboard to run this tutorial.
```

There are three Tutorials:

1. [Basic Authentication](authentication): Build an application that authenticates with Layer's servers.
2. [Basic Conversations](basic-conversations): Build an application that creates and lists Conversations.
3. [Basic Messages](basic-messages): Build an application that sends and receives Messages, and sends Read Receipts.
