# Introduction

This tutorial helps build a simple Backbone Javascript application.  If your looking for templates rather than a tutorial, check our [Sample Apps](https://github.com/layerhq/samples-web-apis) where you will find examples in multiple frameworks.

This sample application will use a sample app id automatically generated for you, and an Identity Service provided by Layer for building samples (but NOT for production applications).
