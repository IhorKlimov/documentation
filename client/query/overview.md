# Query API

The Query API is a work in progress, and will allow you to Query for Conversations, Messages and Announcements that match your criteria.  Querying can be done on a variety of property, including Metadata (i.e. give me all Conversations where metadata.favorites == "true").

Details will be posted once this service is available for users.
